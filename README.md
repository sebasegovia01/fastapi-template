# FastAPI Template

This project is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.10. It uses Uvicorn as the ASGI server to run the application.

## Technologies
- **Python**: 3.10
- **FastAPI**: 0.110.2
- **Uvicorn**: 0.29.0
- **pytest**: For running asynchronous tests
- **httpx**: For making HTTP requests in tests

## Setup and Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.10 installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Creating a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies separately for this project. You can create one using the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Installing Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is active, install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install all necessary packages listed in requirements.txt.

### Running the Application
To run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn, execute the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload  # The `--reload` option enables auto-reload on code changes
```
This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can access the API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.


### Running Tests
To execute tests, ensure you are in the project root directory and run:

```bash
pytest test/test_e2e.py
```
This command will discover and run all tests written in your project, showing the results in the terminal.
